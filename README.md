5.Pandas

INSTALLATION PACKAGES:

*pip install google-api-python-client

*pip install streamlit

*pip install mysql.connector python

*pip install streamlit

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

STREAMLIT:

-Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI. -It enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON:

-Python is a high level programming language. -Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

GOOGLE API CLIENT:

-The googleapiclient library communicat with different Google APIs.

Google API is used to retrieve channel data,video data and comment data from Youtube. SQL (MySQL): -A relational database used as a data warehouse for storing migrated YouTube data. WORKFLOW:

COLLECTION OF DATA:

-Retreiving data from youtube channels using Youtube API key and gaining the information which we required from the channels.

STORAGE OF DATA:

-Once the information is gained it all the store in MySql database.Migration of data to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis. Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database.Support for handling multiple YouTube channels and managing their data.

STREAMLIT DASHBOARD: -The above mentioned all informations are to be described in the Streamlit Dashboard and its functionalities to provide a user friendly interactions to visulaize the data
